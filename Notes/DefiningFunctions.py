# ------------------Functions---------------------
# for some reason function definitions and calls should have 2 empty line above and below
# The keyword def introduces a function definition.
# It must be followed by the function name and the parenthesized list of formal parameters.

# It is also possible to define functions with a variable number of arguments.
# There are three forms, which can be combined.

# The most useful form is to specify a default value for one or more arguments.
# This creates a function that can be called with fewer arguments than it is defined to allow

# We can create a function that writes the fibonacci series to a certain boundary
# The first statement of the function body can optionally be a string literal;
# this string literal is the functionâ€™s documentation string, or docstring.
